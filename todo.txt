Todo:

Update hardware schematics to match reality. 

Now that it works I need to fulfil my promise of making the Worst Alarm Clock Ever. 

Must add feature that chooses an alternate time for your alarm whether you like it or not. 

Maybe also add a feature that turns on a second alarm instead of turning it off? 

Make alarm setting save confirmation show better formatted time. eg. 9:05 instead of 9:5. 

After alarm time is set automatically turn it on.

Make alarm default to still on after dismissal. 

Change to 12 hour time. 24 hour may make more sense logically but I'm not used to it.
